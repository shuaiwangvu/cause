This is for my project on the study of **C Graph** 

In the folder /data_transformation_script you can find some Python script where I transformed the original data in JSONL to TSV (CSV with \tab).

The transformed data comes in two ways:

 1. The original data in TSV: source	target	weight
 2. The common causal relations in TSV: source	target	weight

You can find the data from Zenodo at: XXXXX. There you can find

 - the original C (c-full.jsonl), 14GB 
 - the original C with higher precision (c-precision.jsonl), 990MB
 - the TSV file of the original C, 601MB
 - the file of the C as linked data (in HDT format), X MB
 - the mapping of the C to LOD-a-lot (in HDT), X MB
 - the refined C (in HDT format), Y MB
 - the removed links (in TSV format), Z MB

In the folder /data_analysis you can find some Python script about the analysis of the following aspects:

 - The script analysis of the degrees
 - The script about the analysis of SCC
 - The script about
